arrow-dplyr
This template provides a minimal setup to get arrow working in dplyr with data processing and some pipeline rules.

Currently, two official extensions are available:

@arrow-dplyr/procedural uses ME for Fast Processing

@arrow-dplyr/DT_editor_shiny_module uses Shiny for Interactive Tables
